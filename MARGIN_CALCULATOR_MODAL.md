### Analyzing Margins

1. Once products are added, the table displays:
   - Product name and quantity
   - Cost price (total for quantity)
   - Selling prices for each margin percentage
   - Profit amounts for each margin percentage

2. Click on any margin percentage column header to:
   - Set it as the current margin for the entire application
   - See visual highlighting of that margin across all products

3. For multiple products, the bundle row shows:
   - Total bundle cost
   - Bundle selling prices for each margin percentage

### Managing Products

- **Update Quantity**: Use the quantity input field to adjust product quantities
- **Remove Products**: Click the trash icon to remove products from the calculation

## Technical Implementation

### Components

- **MarginCalculatorModalComponent**: Main slide-out panel component with toggle functionality
- **GlobalMarginPanelComponent**: Global wrapper component for app-wide accessibility
- **MarginStateService**: Manages global margin state across the application
- **MarginPanelService**: Manages panel visibility state with persistence
- **MarginCalculatorService**: Handles margin calculations
- **ProductCatalogService**: Provides product data

### Architecture

The slide-out panel uses a service-based architecture for global state management:

```typescript
// Panel visibility managed globally
MarginPanelService.togglePanel()
MarginPanelService.showPanel()
MarginPanelService.hidePanel()

// Margin state synchronized across app
MarginStateService.setMarginPercentage(15)
MarginStateService.marginPercentage$.subscribe(...)
```

### Integration

The slide-out panel integrates with:
- **App Component**: Globally available via `<app-global-margin-panel>`
- **Margin State**: Syncs with the global margin percentage
- **Product Catalog**: Uses existing product data with cost information
- **Local Storage**: Persists panel state and margin preferences

### Calculation Formula

The modal uses the standard margin calculation formula:
```
Selling Price = Cost ÷ (1 - Margin%)
Profit = Selling Price - Cost
```

### CSS Animations & Styling

The slide-out panel uses CSS transforms and transitions for smooth animations:

```scss
/* Panel slide animations */
.translate-x-full { transform: translateX(100%); }  // Hidden state
.translate-x-0 { transform: translateX(0); }        // Visible state

/* Toggle button positioning */
.-translate-x-16 { transform: translateX(-4rem); }  // When panel is open

/* Smooth transitions */
transition: transform 0.3s ease-in-out;
```

**Key Animation Features:**
- **300ms Duration**: Optimal balance between smooth and responsive
- **Ease-in-out Timing**: Natural acceleration and deceleration
- **Transform-based**: Hardware-accelerated animations for better performance
- **Z-index Management**: Proper layering with toggle button (z-50) and panel (z-40)

## Design Principles

### Minimalist Design
- Clean typography and generous white space
- Simplified neutral color palette with strategic accents
- Reduced visual clutter while maintaining professional appearance

### User-Friendly Interface
- Descriptive field labels and helpful tooltips
- Intuitive visual cues and icons
- Logical information hierarchy for immediate comprehension

### Color Coding
